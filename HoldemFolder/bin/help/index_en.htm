The card range is presented as a table with hole cards. Pairs are located diagonally, cards of different suits are located to the left from the diagonal, cards of the same suit are located to the right. Cards of different suits are marked by with <b>о</b> character, cards of the same suit are marked with the <b>s</b> character. You should use this table to define your playing range, i.e. cards you prefer to play with. Holdem Folder will fold all other (unselected) cards.

<h4>Running the room agent</h4>
<p>
After you select the card range and specify the settings, you should close the configuration tool and run Holdem Agent for your room.

Holdem Agent will appear in the system tray and notify you that it has been successfully loaded. You can use it to start or stop the auto-folding process.
<p>
Use the following global hotkeys: Ctrl+F5 – start,  Ctrl+F6 – stop, Ctrl+F10 – exit.
<p>
A right click on the agent icon opens the action menu.

<h4>If the autofolding process does not start</h4>
 
<p>If the autofolding process does not start, make sure your poker room looks right. You can find the description of what poker rooms should look like in the Rooms section on <u>http://holdemfold.com/rooms/</u>.
